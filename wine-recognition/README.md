# Wine Classification Project

## Overview

This repository contains code and resources for a wine classification project using the Wine dataset from Scikit-Learn. The primary objective of this project is to develop and evaluate machine learning models that can classify wines into different categories based on various chemical features. Wine classification is a common problem in the wine industry, and accurate classification can help wine producers and enthusiasts make informed decisions about wine quality and characteristics.

## Project Description

Wine classification involves categorizing wines into different types, such as red or white, and even more specific classifications based on characteristics like grape variety, region, or vintage year. Machine learning models can be employed to automate this process, making it faster and more consistent than manual classification.

The goal of this project is to explore various machine learning algorithms and models to classify wines accurately, with a focus on improving the precision, recall, and overall predictive performance of the classifiers.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is the **Wine** dataset from Scikit-Learn. This dataset contains various attributes related to wine composition, such as acidity, alcohol content, pH, and more. It is a commonly used dataset for wine quality classification and regression tasks.

## Installation

To run the code in this repository, follow these installation steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/wine-recognition.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd wine-recognition
   ```

3. Create a virtual environment (recommended):

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   ```

## Usage

To use the wine classifiers developed in this project, you can refer to the provided Jupyter notebooks or Python scripts. The primary entry points are the model training and evaluation scripts.

## Models

In this project, we explore various machine learning models for wine classification.

Each model is implemented and evaluated separately, with a focus on comparing their performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Evaluation

The evaluation of the wine classifiers is a crucial aspect of this project. We assess the model performance using various metrics and techniques, including cross-validation, confusion matrices, ROC curves, and AUC-ROC scores. The results and conclusions are documented in the project notebooks and reports.
